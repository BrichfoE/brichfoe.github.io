This codebase is intended as replacement of my own personal website.  I created it a while ago using the weebly web builder supplied by iPage, but have since learned to do a spot of coding myself and can get pretty far using GitHub pages and not pay iPage to host my site.

I started from a Jekyll template called "Noir" and plan to make updates slowly over time.  It was very easy to download the requisite files into my repo and it took very few edits to start using it for my own purposes.

Here is a link if you'd like to learn more about Noir : [https://noir.essentialenemy.com](https://noir.essentialenemy.com)
