## Greetings and Salutations
Well, clearly the last month did not go as I had planned.  So what happened here?

Well a couple things.  First, I had some reasons for not posting for a couple weeks, but no one want to hear those excuses so I will spare you those.  Then I hit a roadblock which caused me to lose my motivation to keep churning on this particular project altogether.  Fortunately, I've had something of a breakthrough this weekend, so I should be back on the horse starting tomorrow.  However, I thought it best to say a few words about what roadblock I ran into and my breakthrough, which should leave me clear to start running with the outcome of this weekend starting tomorrow.

## The Dead End
About a month ago on this very blog, I spent a good deal of time talking about how wonderfully I had scoped my project.  I had managed to take a huge idea and whittle it down to the core concept of a game where you exclusively manage people, ditching the omnipotence of the usual manager in this sort of game.  The issue arose last weekend while I was working on the dialogue options and how you would interact with the workers on your farm.  I realized I had already been working on this thing for almost a month and I was just now sitting down to the core mechanic in my game, and most disappointingly of all *I could not work out how to make it fun*.  I had gotten lost in all the things your workers could do and building your farm, and hadn't really sunk any time into the core idea that I found compelling in the first place.  And now I had surrounded this core idea with the baggage of my implementation of how the tasks themselves would work, so I felt constrained by the two weeks of on-and-off work which prevented me from quickly iterating on this core concept and having the game grow organically out of that.

In short, I kind of gave up for a couple days.  After my vacation I did do some work putting up the dialogue screen and adding skills and preferences for the workers so they would level up at various tasks and be more or less content based on their preferences.  However, after about a week of that when I started to think about how I was going to present it for this blog, I could not for the life of me work out a way to make a compelling case for my central idea.  I was basically starting to create a less inventive version of Rimworld, which is not what I had set out to do.  Game over.

## The Path Forward
For about half a week I was agonizing about whether or not to scrap what I had done and start over.  Eventually I realized that part of the problem was that I had selected a management game as my first full-fledged game.  The scope was too large for the amount of time I am able to spend on it these days, and I was pretty much doomed to sputter before I had finished a prototype that I would be willing to share and get feedback on.

Now I have done a couple other mini-games, but neither one was terribly complex.   One was a text-based monster builder and did not use an engine that I used to teach myself how to code and I never had anyone playtest it.  The other and the other was a hack and slash using Unity that I had created as a Christmas present for one person.  This project, however, is supposed to get me into that space where I'm putting something out there, getting some feedback, and implementing changes (even if that feedback will likely come exclusively from family and friends).  If it is too complex, I will grind on it for months before I am satisfied enough to let anyone else see it.

To that end, I am going to shift into making a different game.  This new one will be even simpler, more focused, and hopefully easier to find the fun in.  I still like the idea for Rex Anglorum, and I will likely come back to it sometime down the road.  When I do I hope I remember to attack the core problem first and move on to the domain managing second.

It should be easier to move quicker with the Unity library now that I have been futzing with it for a month, but the most valuable thing I will be feeding into this next project will be the lesson of ruthlessly sticking to the core gameplay loop before even thinking about the level layout.  The idea I have had should also lend itself to an even more focused approach.  If you would like to know what that is, tune in tomorrow morning for the kickoff of what I am pivoting into.
