## Greetings and Salutations
Good morning, dear hallucinatory reader.  Today is a brand-new day, free from the shame of past failures.  I heartily look forward to my future failures, so let's set up the expectations that I will fall down on.

## What is the New Thing?
The New Thing does not yet have a title, but it will be set in the borderlands that pop up all over your history books.  The premise is that you play as either the local garrison commander of the region attempting to fend off annual raids by your neighbors, or you play as those neighbors trying to make off with as much loot as possible.  I plan to work the word [march](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_(territory)) into the title, but I figure that can get worked out later.

This idea actually came to me some time ago when listening to Robin Pierson's History of Byzantium podcast (specifically [this episode](https://thehistoryofbyzantium.com/2015/12/04/episode-87-the-house-of-war/) if I had to guess) and thinking about what life would have been like living in one of these places of perpetual warfare where conquest was not the goal, just plunder.

## Could you be more specific about the New Thing?
I am envisioning a 2D strategy wargame centering around these raids.  Each raid functions as a round, before which you as the player decide your overall strategy based on your current resources.  Then the round develops in turns where you adapt to the chosen strategy of the opposing player.  Success during the round determines the resources available for the next round, eventually leading to ultimate victory in establishing dominance.  While ending in conquest is less accurate (that sort of shift usually took decades), I expect it will be more compelling as a goal.

As the aggressor, your objective is to maximize how much loot you come away with.  At the beginning of a raid you plan your overall strategy, and have an opportunity at each turn to modify your armyâ€™s route.  You will have very little information on your first raid of where settlements are or their relative defenses or wealth.  You will have to balance the risks of going after wealthier settlements which are farther from your base which may be better defended and will certainly leave you open to ambush on your return.  As you are more and more successful with raids, you attract larger raiding parties to your command, and eventually you can support an army of conquest to carve out your domain, settling the march permanently for your side.

As the defender, you try to anticipate the path of the raid and either get out of the way or perhaps ambush the raiding party as it tries to return to its territory.  Before the raiding season starts, you can reposition what few troops are at your disposal to anticipate the attack.  It is safest to wait to ambush the raiders on their return trip, but this will deplete your resources somewhat if successful, and tremendously if you are unsuccessful. With more resources you can eventually shift to a more aggressive strategy, building confidence in the security of your region, eventually building defenses on the boarder permanently securing the march for your side.

## How does the New Thing play into yesterday's post?
The whole point of this exercise is that I am trying to find a core mechanic to find the fun in and go from there.  I [lost steam on my last project](/DD-RA-OnPause/) because I could not isolate those pieces in a satisfying way. Let's break down why I think this new game has a simpler concept than my attempt from last month.

- Manage people's tasks to build your farm
    - three distinct nouns
        - people
        - task
        - farm
    - two distinct verbs
        - manage
        - build
- Move an army around a board and fight another army
    - two distinct nouns
        - army
        - board
    - two distinct verbs 
        - move
        - fight

Now that may seem like the older proposition only has one more moving piece, but also consider the difference between the verbs "manage" and "fight".  "Manage" is actually a super broad term and could cover trying to motivate people, deciding the order of operations, reprimanding bad actors, etc.  "Fight" is much more straightforward, because it is easy to add fisticuffs to a game.  "Task" too is a generic noun that actually covers a lot of ground.  Farming, herding, building, and negotiating were all things I had on that list grouped together as "tasks", so it was very easy to get distracted by any of these offshoots without actually making sure the foundation was firm.

## What have I done so far for the New Thing?
Very little.  I wrote out a more thorough design document this time to make sure I had it all out in front of me, and I set up a Unity project with empty base classes and a testing framework.  I only started real work yesterday, so we will have to wait for next Monday for any report of significant progress.

## Concluding Remarks
I know that no one is reading these (no really, I just checked Google Analytics and I am the only person who has loaded any of these pages), but having this sort of publicly available forum does help motivate me to keep pushing on these things.  Maybe it's due to the remote possibility that maybe this game or a future one will get me noticed and people will read through all the old posts that keep the threat of public embarrassment real.  If anyone is interested in trying to hold themselves accountable, I recommend this sort of public posting in a place that no one will ever see.  Just remember to not print anything you wouldn't want your mother to read.
