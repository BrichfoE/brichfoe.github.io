## You're a hairy Wizard!
Not sure how long I'll keep this up, but I watched _Shazam!_ yesterday and thought I would share some thoughts.  I feel like I had two overarching thoughts.

    1. It's good to see DC employing people who know how to have fun
    2. I'm still waiting to see a DC movie that I don't have reservations around

Wonder Woman was excellent, and Aquaman was just bonkers enough to be good fun.
