I decided to start blogging again today (I had one a couple years ago, it's here for those interested in reading about my time in Japan),  and the line "I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship" came to mind.

Of course, this line reminded me of when I was young and the two things I loved most were samurai and Film Noir.  Naturally, I began to imagine a crossover.  This quickly snowballed into a series of shorts which I claimed would be five minutes long, though looking back each would probably take less than thirty seconds on average.

I'll recount the first one for your entertainment.  Keep in mind, I couldn't have been much older than ten when I came up with this one Saturday Morning.

We fade in to see Humphrey Bogart dressed in a trench coat and fedora, walking into the fog in a scene identical to the last shot of Casablanca.  However, it is not Claude Rains he is walking with.  Instead, it is Mifune Toshiro, dressed the armor he wore in The Seven Samurai.

Bogart wryly says, "Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."  Mifune stops, turns towards Bogart, the wild rage building in his eyes.  Bogart stops and looks back just in time to see the sword leaving its scabbard, rising up in a perfect arc, and coming down again.  The screen cuts to black just as the blade is making contact with Bogart's fedora.

The End.

As I said, I came up with dozens of these, and teach time they took place in a different setting.  Somehow, Bogart seemed to remember what had happened in the last installment.  Before long he always had his gun at the ready at the first sign of anything vaguely Japanese.  Mifune's attacks became more elaborate in an effort maintain the element of surprise.  Again, they always ended the same way, with Mifune getting the better of Bogart, and the screen cutting to black as soon as Bogart's end came.

I'm not sure I want to unpack what any of this says about my childhood.  Regardless, here are my questions of the day.  

If I got someone to illustrate/animate these,
- do you think anyone would want to see them?
- do you think anyone would want to pay money for them?
- should it be done with each one as an individual flip book?
